Populate Me
===========

Overview
--------

Warning: This is a work in process so this is why no gem is currently released with this code. If you install the Gem, you would have the version of the branch called `ground-zero`.

`PopulateMe` is a modular system which provides an admin backend for any Ruby/Rack web application.
It is made with Sinatra but you can code your frontend with any other Framework like Rails.

Documents
---------

The `field` method allows you to record anything about
itself, but here are the keys used by `PopulateMe`:

- `:type` Defines the type of field (please find the list of types below).
- `:form_field` Set to `false` if you do not want this field in the default form.
- `:label` What the label in the form says (defaults to a human-friendly version of the field name)
- `:wrap` Set it to false if you do not want the form field to be wrapped in a `div` with a label.

Available types are:

- `:string` Short text.
- `:text` Multiline text.
- `:boolean` Which is `true` or `false`.
- `:list` List of nested documents.
- `:select` Dropdown list of options (records a string).
